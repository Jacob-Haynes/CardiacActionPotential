Excitable cell membranes are a key dynamic system in biology, crucial for many biological functions. One such example is the cardiac action potential which drives the electrophysiology of the heart. We will aim to model the cardiac action potential via two methods. Firstly, electronically with the goal of building a circuit to simulate a single cell and then a small network of cells. This will be used to simulate the effect of a uni-directional blocker, resulting in tachycardia and then its treatment via ablation. Secondly, computationally using a method motivated by the electronic model. The computational model uses a reaction diffusion model described by Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations to govern the action potential of a three dimensional cubic lattice of cells. The computational model will then be used to simulate tachycardia and its treatment. The Fitzhugh-Nagumo computational model that is presented in this paper successfully simulates cardiac cell action potentials and propagation comparable to existing models, but at a fraction of the computational cost. A potential novel method of individual patient tailored drug dosing estimates using the model is also proposed.
